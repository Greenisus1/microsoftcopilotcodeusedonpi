everyone ummm here is the directory 

Here’s how you can grab and run your coolpi.sh on any Pi:

Download the raw script from GitHub:

bash:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Greenisus1/microsoftcopilotcodeusedonpi/main/coolpi.sh -O coolpi.sh
Make it executable:

bash:
chmod +x coolpi.sh
This sets the “execute” bit so you can launch it directly.

Run it:

bash:
./coolpi.sh
(Or, if you prefer):

bash:
bash coolpi.sh
Both will invoke the shebang at the top and fire up your dialog-driven menu.
